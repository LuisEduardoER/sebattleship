Since the actual ship Battleship needs to be that class, I thought the driver class should be named BattleshipGame.
Also, I can't open up any of the .class files in Eclipse.

I added most of the gameplay classes.  
-Board Setup team needs to modify the Ship class' set_position function.  I'm not sure if you'd prefer to do that directly 
in your other classes or here.  

-My_Board and Opponent_Board need the display functions.
