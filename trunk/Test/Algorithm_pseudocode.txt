count occurance of each possible value in row
if a value only occurs in the same grid, eliminate that value from all other cells in that grid

count occurance of each possible value in col
if a value only occurs in the same gride, eliminate that value from all other cells in that grid

count occurance of each possible value in grid
if a value only occurs in the same row/col, eliminate that value from all other cels in that row/col




how?

create a giant 3-D array [possible value(0-8)][occurance(0-80)][row and column(0,1)]






check row
